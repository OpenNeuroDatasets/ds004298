The London Health Sciences Center Parkinson’s disease (LHSCPD) dataset consists of 40 subjects diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (age: 60.2 ± 6.8, sex: 13 female and 27 male) and have undergone Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery. 

The subjects had pre-DBS gadolinium-enhanced imaging collected at our institution (University Hospital in London, ON, Canada) with a 1.5 T scanner (Signa, General Electric, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA). 

We also release anatomical fiducial (AFIDs) placements on this local dataset. AFIDs placements were performed using 3D Slicer version 4.10.0 on structural T1w images. A total of 5 AFIDs protocol applications were performed (6,400 fiducials).
